## Favorite labs from CPSC 120L

Lab 7 Part 1:
This was also one of the labs that I enjoyed the most because of the different parking functions and combinations to practice on. It was a great lab to get used to the new functions that we learned in lectures.
 
Lab 8 Part 2:
I liked this lab because it was a great way to practice coding by not having the use of words or input of questions like enter a number or a phrase, it was also fun trying to get the lab to work with all the different outputs me and my lab partner were getting with the dots and dashes.

Lab 12 Part 1:
I really liked this lab because although it was different from other labs in the process of filling in the blanks of coding I liked working with color and motions. It really showcases the different ways that programming can be utilized.
